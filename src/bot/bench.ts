/**
 * Can't Stop's strength-benchmark entry point — adapts self-play to the kernel `runBenchmark` (REVIEW.md
 * Tier 5). It knows the two game-specific things the kernel can't: how to seed a game, and how to read the
 * winning seats off the end state.
 *
 * **Can't Stop's setup is fixed; its randomness is the per-turn dice.** So `makeInitial(seed)` bundles a
 * freshly-seeded dice generator alongside the (identical) board — different seeds are different dice
 * sequences, which is what makes two seeded games different. The dice source is remade per game, so the
 * same seed always plays the same dice, and every rotation of the candidate through the seats replays the
 * same board+dice for a fair comparison.
