/**
 * Choose this bot's next action in Can't Stop.
 *
 * `view` is `viewFor(state, playerId)` — but Can't Stop hides nothing, so the view *is* the whole
 * state (the redaction is a no-op). The returned action is always legal for `applyAction`:
 * - **selecting** → the highest-scoring legal pairing (`SELECT`).
 * - **rolling** → roll again or `STOP`, per the risk model. Rolling needs dice the bot can't invent, so
 *   it calls `options.rollDice` (the caller's injected randomness) and throws a `BotError` without it —
 *   the same contract Container's `decide` has for `collectBids`.
 *
 * `options.difficulty` (default `'normal'`, so every existing caller is unchanged) selects the
 * parameter set the risk model runs under (CS4) — the tiers scale probability thresholds, never swap
 * the model.
