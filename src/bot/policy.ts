/**
 * The Can't Stop bot's opinions — a pure risk model. Can't Stop has no hidden information, so unlike
 * Container there is nothing to estimate about opponents: every decision is a straight expected-value
 * bet on the dice. The weights below are heuristic and tunable (that's why the bot's coverage gate is
 * 90%, not 100%); what must hold is that every decision is legal and self-play always terminates.
 *
 * ## Difficulty tiers (CS4)
 *
 * The owner's ask — "scale difficulty on probability levels, don't replace the model" — so a tier is a
 * **parameter set over this same exact-probability machinery** (`DifficultyParams`), never a different
 * algorithm:
 * - **normal** — the frozen baseline (`NORMAL`). Every `shouldRoll`/`pickPairing`/`scorePairing` call
 *   with no params defaults to it, so self-play and the strength baselines stay **byte-identical**.
 * - **easy** — risk-shy: a hard `stopThreshold` banks as soon as bust probability crosses it *even when
 *   EV says roll on*, and a lower `expectedAdvance` values pushing less. It visibly banks early.
 * - **hard** — the full EV rule plus endgame urgency: `urgencyBoost` scales both the roll-on incentive
 *   and the claim bonus when a public-state read says an opponent is racing to their third column.
