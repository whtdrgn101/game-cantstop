 * `collectBids`. When the bot decides to roll, it needs four dice, but a pure bot can't produce them;
 * the caller supplies them (self-play from a seeded rng, the backend runner from `ctx.rng`). `decide`
 * throws a `BotError` if it wants to roll and none was given.
 *
 * `difficulty` (CS4) picks which parameter set the risk model runs under. Omitted ⇒ `'normal'`, the
 * frozen baseline — so every pre-CS4 caller behaves exactly as before.
