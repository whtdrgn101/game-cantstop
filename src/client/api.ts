/**
 * Can't Stop's own API client — the endpoints only this game has.
 *
 * The platform client (`lib/api.ts`) owns `/games`, `/games/:id`, `/actions` and the stream; a game's
 * own routes live under `/games/:id/<gameType>/…` (roadmap C1). Can't Stop's only extra endpoint is the
 * dice roll, which is a *server* action (the dice must be rolled with server randomness), so it lives
 * here rather than as an opaque `/actions` move.
 *
 * This file is also where Can't Stop's **types** re-enter: `lib/api.ts` hands out `unknown` states, and
 * these wrappers pin them back to `CantStopView` so the board is fully typed. `unknown` at the seam,
 * never inside a board.
