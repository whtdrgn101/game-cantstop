// Can't Stop's `record()` is the shared kernel one verbatim — bump `version`, append one log entry —
// so it re-exports rather than re-implements (the shape turned out common across all three games;
// see REVIEW.md §3.2). `record(state, type, playerId, changes?, payload?)`.
export { record } from '@game-hub/kernel';
