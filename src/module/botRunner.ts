 * `viewFor(state, botId)`, and hands actions to the same `applyAction` a human's move goes through.
 *
 * The one Can't Stop wrinkle: rolling needs randomness the pure bot can't invent, so the runner passes
 * `decide` a `rollDice` drawn from the same `rng` (via `rollFourDice`) the `/roll` route uses — so a
 * bot rolls exactly as a person does. `tick` plays bots forward synchronously until a human is on the
 * clock, so a caller can read the game back afterwards.
