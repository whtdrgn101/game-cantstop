 * test of the C0/C1/C2 seams: a game with no hidden information (so `viewFor` is a no-op), no bots, and
 * per-turn randomness the shared core knows nothing about (its dice roll lives behind `routes`, drawn
 * from the injected `ctx.rng`). Nothing Container-shaped leaks into the core to make this work.
